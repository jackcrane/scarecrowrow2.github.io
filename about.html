      Scarecrow Row is a fun fall installation of unique and creative scarecrows set along the 2-mile bike and walking trail of Otto Armleder Park, located on Cincinnati’s eastside next to Lunken Airport and Playfield.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Individuals, organizations and businesses submit one of a kind, themed scarecrows, that will amuse and entertain visitors throughout the month of October. It’s free and family friendly
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Scarecrow Row is a proud supporter of Madi’s House, a relapse prevention and mental health community center, serving young adults battling addiction and mental health illness in the greater Cincinnati area.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      For each scarecrow that is submitted we are hoping to raise $250 for this great cause. You can donate individually, or create a team to collectively raise the donation. Form your team today to raise money in support of Madi’s House. We need you to help make Scarecrow Row for Madi’s House a success, so that we can best serve the young adults who battle their illness every day.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      If it’s been a tough year, and you are only able to create a scarecrow that will delight the community, we understand and would still love to accept your creation. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      You’ll also definitely want to pack a picnic lunch or dinner, and bring your family down to experience Scarecrow Row.
